Starting with Linux on Alpha in 1993, I soon found that there were more bugs to fix in the compiler tool chain than there were in the kernel itself. In 1997, I converted that hobby into a proper job with Cygnus Solutions, doing compiler tool chain and simulator development. Time passed, companies merged, hardware died, and I found myself contributing to QEMU for continuing Alpha support, and converting that hobby into a proper job with Linaro.
