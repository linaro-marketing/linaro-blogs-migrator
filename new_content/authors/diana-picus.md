Diana has been hacking on various parts of LLVM since her late university days. Her first job was at Freescale (now NXP), but after a while she joined Linaro to focus on open source development. Diana is currently working on flang, but has also been involved with lldb for Morello, the Arm and AArch64 backends, as well as writing the occasional middle-end optimization pass or clang-based source-to-source tool. She also sometimes enjoy dabbling in the less technical side of things, so was on the program committee for some of the LLVM developers' meetings and also organized a few LLVM socials in Stockholm.
