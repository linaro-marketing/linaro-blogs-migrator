I am a Senior Software Engineer, working for Linaro. I have been contributed to OSS since 2007 when I started working on VLC Media player at university. I worked for 5 years at STMicroelectronics where I ported the v8 JavaScript engine on sh4 processors. I also contributed to many OSS projects like proot, care, debian and qemu. I am now a Maintainer and Architect of LAVA, a widely adopted framework to test software (bootloader, kernel, user space) on real boards.
